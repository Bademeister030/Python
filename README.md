## [E375004-Python-for-Scientific-Computations-and-Control](E375004.md)




[Click here](course-2375004.md)







This projects was originaly developed at CTU for students of automatic control. It has no ambition to be full python course, but more like brief introduction followed by useful tools for automatic control and other disciplines connected to this topic.

## Getting Started

We do not presuppose any knowledge about python, however we do presuppose some basic knowledge from field of algorithmization (e.g., sorting algorithms) and mathematics (e.g., linear algebra and differential equatins).

### Prerequisites

### Installing

To succesfully clone this repository to your computer and use it, git and python interpreter will be needed.
Git can be downloaded here [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads).
You can download lates version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or use [anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/). Anyway install python 3.5 or higher.
Once you have downloaded and successfully installed those tools, you can clone this repository by terminal command:
```
git clone https://github.com/CVUT-FS-12110/Python-for-scientific-computation-and-control.git
```
If you are experiencing python for the first time, you can skip installing virtual enviroment, however we highly recommend that by terminal command:
```
python -m pip install virtualenv
```
or if you are using ubuntu, python will be propably reserved for python 2.7 so you need to use correct alias (usually python3 or py3):
```
python3 -m pip install virtualenv
```
